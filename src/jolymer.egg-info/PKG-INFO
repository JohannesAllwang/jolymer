# Code Documentation

## TODOs:

- kww.
- exceptions are not unique.
- The way that samples are stored in the database should be improved (I don't know how yet, but creating a new table for each kind of sample can't work forever...)
- it should be possible to use n and viscosity from measurements.

## For others:

To make this usable by other people I have to change the following things:

- the path to the rawdata, and to the database are hardcoded (Should be solved with a .jolymer file).
- There should be some script that creates an empty database for a potential user.
- Alternative constructors for people, who don't want to use the database.

## instrument classes and sql database
